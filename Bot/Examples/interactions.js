/**
 * @file Discord interaction handler for a bot using discord.js
 * @description This module exports an interaction handler for Discord, which
 * can be used for buttons, select menus, or modals. It defines how interactions
 * of a specific type should be handled by the bot.
 *
 * - **id**: Represents the identifier of the interaction. `{!}` is a placeholder
 *   that can be replaced by a dynamic value during runtime.
 * - **noDeferred**: Indicates whether the interaction should be deferred:
 *   - If `false`, the response is automatically deferred, and you must use
 *     `editReply()` to respond.
 *   - If `true`, the response is not deferred, and you can use `.reply()` to
 *     respond directly.
 * - **ephemeral**: If `true`, the response will be ephemeral (visible only to
 *   the user). This is only applicable when `noDeferred` is `false` or
 *   undefined.
 * - **type**: Defines the type of interaction being handled. This can be a
 *   `"button"`, `"selectMenu"`, or `"modal"`.
 *
 * **Parameters for the `execute` function**:
 * - `interaction` (`Interaction`): Represents the interaction object that is
 *   triggered by the user.
 * - `client` (`Client`): Represents the bot instance, allowing access to all
 *   client methods and properties.
 * - `pattern` (`string`): Represents the value that replaces `{!}` in the `id`.
 *   This value is dynamically extracted when the interaction is triggered.
 *
 * The `execute` function is asynchronous (`async`) to handle any required
 * asynchronous operations, such as API calls or data retrieval, during the
 * interaction.
